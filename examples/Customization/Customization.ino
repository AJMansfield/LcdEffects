/*
  Custom Characters and Effects

  This sketch demonstrates how you can create your own custom character effects.

  The arduino is connected to the LCD in this example over I2C, but this should work just
  fine with other types of LCDs, just swap out the library headers and declaration to
  the ones for what you have.
